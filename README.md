I've always been a fan of the Pokemon TCG and thought it would be fun to make a custom card creator. At first I did all the card backgrounds and details with CSS, but I found some good quality card assests and decided to add those instead so it would look higher quality.

The main feature I like is the drag and drop image adding. The custom card making websites I've seen add images to the card by uploading a file, which is less user friendly, imo. It took a while to figure out how to add drag and drop for an image, but I eventually got it working. Most of what I could find online was dropping an image and drawing it onto a canvas element or something similar, but I figured it should be possible to add the image URL directly to the src of an image element. And it turns out you can.

I'm still working on making the UI better and adding more features, and I might put it out there for people to use eventually when I think it's finished.
